File Searcher for Windows

The File Searcher for Windows is a Python script designed to facilitate efficient file searches on Windows operating systems. It provides a versatile and customizable solution for searching files across multiple directories, leveraging comprehensive error handling mechanisms.

It intelligently excludes common folders, such as Desktop, Documents, Downloads, Pictures, and Videos from recent and pinned folders to ensure faster and more efficient file searching.
